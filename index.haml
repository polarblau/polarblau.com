  %section.about
    %p
      Polarblau is a tiny software shop run by me, Florian.
      %br
      I am helping companies of all sizes &mdash; from start&ndash;ups
      to global cooperations &mdash; to build better software.

    .description
      %p
        Creating software poses a fascinating and unique challenge every time.
        Excited developers and designers will create exciting products.
        &mdash; Let's not take the fun out of it by adding extra weight through
        clunky processes, lenghty meetings or tons of needless paperwork.
      %p
        I believe in small teams, direct responsibilities and transparency all the way.

      %h4
        Open Source
      %p
        The core principles of Open Source go a long way and I try to invest
        as much time as possible into my own and other's Open Source projects.
